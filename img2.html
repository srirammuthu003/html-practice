    <h1>Sriram Cricket Training and Tournaments </h1>
    <p>Step onto the pitch where legends are born and dreams take flight. Cricket isn’t just a game—it’s a battle of nerves, a dance of strategy, and a test of spirit. One swing can silence a crowd, one delivery can change the tide. From the roar of the crowd to the thump of leather on willow, every moment echoes with passion. Breathe in focus, breathe out fear. Play bold, defend proud, and chase victory with every heartbeat. Because when you hold the bat or mark your run-up, you don’t just play the game—you live it. This is cricket: the game of pride, grit, and glory.</p>
